# 🧑‍🎓 Student Buddy – LeetCode Learning Companion

**Student Buddy** is a Chrome extension that helps students improve problem-solving skills on platforms like **LeetCode**.  
Instead of giving full solutions, it provides **progressive hints** (Concept → Approach → Example) to guide your thinking process step by step.
